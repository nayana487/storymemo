Week 1

For just over a month, I've been collecting police reports from the east side Baltimore County police precincts.

My process of collection is to go to the Parkville, North Point, White Marsh and Essex precincts every Monday morning, between 10 a.m. and noon. Each precinct's administrative officer will print out the reports for me that were filed since Monday of the previous week.

At the Parkville, White Marsh and Essex precincts, I'm able to take scans of the reports on my phone. The North Point precinct has me transcribe the information I want from the reports into my notebook.

At this point, I have 126 records from four precincts.
 
With this data, I've created a spreadsheet, that I update weekly, with the initial following categories: Precinct, Date, Location, Incident Charge, Suspect Information, Description.

As you suggested, I added a date/time occurred column and date/time reported column.  I can go back to the reports I have from the precincts that let me take the photos and update the spreadsheet. I scheduled an appointment next week to go to North Point to review all the printed out records to fill in the date/time reported info that I hadn't been recording before.

I'm still thinking about what questions I can ask from the data. Just eyeballing the spreadsheet, I can see some types of crime that I thought were odd that actually happen fairly frequently such as burglars stealing copper wires from buildings. 

Week 2


This week, I've primarily continued collecting reports from the east side police precincts.

I was up against a tight deadline for a story I had to file at the Sun on Monday, so I had to wait until Wednesday to get the reports. This also screwed me up because I wasn't able to make the time this week to go back and fill in the holes in my data from the Dundalk precinct, which is the one where I have to transcribe the reports instead of taking photos.

I also wasn't able to go to the Parkville precinct so far this week because the administrative officer I usually deal with there hasn't been available since my usual Monday appointment. As a result, I'm a week behind in data for this precinct, but I should be able to catch up by next week.

I've also been thinking about how I should be analyzing the data. Although most of the incidents across all precincts are burglaries, there are some precincts that have more violent crimes such as robberies and assaults than others.

I also thought about looking for which blocks in each precinct have the highest number of a specific crime. Eyeballing the data, I've been able to see certain street names pop up more so than others.

Week 3


I'm continuing to collect data from the police precincts for my database. I've caught up on the reports that I've missed from the previous week, when I had to change the time that I typically go to collect the reports.

As far as how I'm going to tackle the problem with the intersections, I think I'm just going to go with the one listed first. It seems like too much of an undertaking to try and determine which of the two roads is the one most traveled for four different jurisdictions. And, I'm not even sure if and where that data is available. I know that the state highway administration and the county do test how much some roads are traveled when determining if renovations are needed, but I don't think they do it for all roads.

Also, I've started to notice that some of the bigger incidents such as homicides don't seem to be listed in the incident summaries that I'm collecting. I need to figure out what sort of crimes get summaries, and what's excluded. 

When I was doing the homework last night, I tried to do this with the motor vehicle thefts data, but struggled to determine where the theft should count if two streets (intersections) are listed. I know I'll have a similar problem with my data set.
